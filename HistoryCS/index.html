<h1>The Mother of All Demos</h1>
    <p>The Mother of All Demos was a 90-minute presentation given by Douglas Engelbart on December 9, 1968, at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. It showcased the capabilities of the oN-Line System (NLS), which Engelbart and his team had been developing at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).</p>
    <p>In the presentation, Engelbart demonstrated various features of the NLS, including hypertext, a mouse, a graphic user interface, video conferencing, and collaborative real-time editing.</p>
    <p>Because of all the innovative features demonstrated in the Mother of All Demos, it is often regarded as a pivotal moment in the history of computer science.</p>

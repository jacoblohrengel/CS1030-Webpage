        <p>Welcome — this page is about my first motorcycle, a classic Triumph Bonneville T100, a 2014 model.</p>
        <p>This bike has been a source of joy, adventure, and learning for me. I have always wanted to ride a motorcycle.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 2024 I took my first motorcycle classes and passed with a 650CC+ rating</p>
        <p>In the winter of 2025 I purchased this bike, and have been riding it ever since.</p>
        <p>I really believe my experience as a Bus Operator has helped me become a safer and more aware motorcyclist.</p>
        <p>As in a Bus you are big and need to look out for everything, on a motorcycle you are small and need to look out for everything</p>

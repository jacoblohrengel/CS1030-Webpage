			<h2>It's All In The Name</h2>
			<p>The name Bonneville derives from the famous Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, USA, where Triumph and others attempted to break the motorcycle speed records.</p>
            <p>These salt flats are a vast, flat expanse of land covered in a thick layer of salt, which creates an ideal surface for high-speed runs. The area has been used for land speed record attempts since the early 20th century.</p>
            <p>Triumph named their Bonneville model after this iconic location to evoke the spirit of speed, adventure, and the pursuit of excellence that the salt flats represent. The Bonneville has since become a symbol of classic British motorcycling, known for its timeless design and performance.</p>

<br>
    <p>Education and proactive measures are key to defending against social engineering attacks. Companies should train employees to recognize the warning signs of these attacks, including suspicious links, typos in domain names, and urgent or unusual requests. Fostering a culture of verification is equally important; employees should be encouraged to independently confirm suspicious requests, such as a vendor asking to change payment details, through a secondary, trusted channel before proceeding.</p>
<br>
    <p>In addition to training, implementing technical and procedural safeguards can significantly reduce risk. Adopting the principle of least privilege, which limits an employee's access to only the data and systems they need for their job, can minimize the potential damage of a successful attack. Furthermore, conducting regular phishing simulations and using technical protections like 24/7 threat monitoring services can help organizations identify vulnerabilities and respond to threats before they cause widespread harm.</p>
<br>
    <p>To protect yourself from social engineering attacks, consider the following strategies:</p>
        <ul>
               <li><b>Be Skeptical:</b> Always question the legitimacy of requests for sensitive information.</li>
               <li><b>Verify Identities:</b> Confirm the identity of individuals or organizations before sharing information.</li>
               <li><b>Educate Yourself:</b> Stay informed about the latest social engineering tactics and how to recognize them.</li>
</ul>

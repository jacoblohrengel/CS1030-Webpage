    <h2>GPU Architecture Comparison</h2>
    
<p>I am looking at upgrading my current GPU that is a RTX 3080 12GB, there have now been 2 generations since its release, and I want to see how the latest models compare.
</br>
</br>
The models I am looking at are the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and the RTX 5070TI. All of these models are from the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs, the 5000 series, which is based on the Blackwell 2.0 architecture.
</br>
</br>
The RTX 5090 is the flagship model of the series, boasting 21,760 CUDA cores, 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM, and a memory bandwidth of 1.79 TB/s. It is designed for extreme performance and is targeted at enthusiasts and professionals who require the best possible performance for gaming, content creation, and AI workloads.
</br>
</br>
The RTX 5080 is a step down from the 5090, with 10,752 CUDA cores, 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, and a memory bandwidth of 960 GB/s. It is still a high-end GPU and is suitable for most gaming and content creation tasks, but it is not as powerful as the 5090.
</br>
</br>
The RTX 5070TI is the most affordable option of the three, with 8960 CUDA cores, 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, and a memory bandwidth of 896 GB/s. It is designed for gamers who want good performance at a more reasonable price point.
</br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After looking at the specifications and prices of the three GPUs, I have decided that the RTX 5070TI is the best option for me. While the RTX 5090 offers the best performance, it is also significantly more expensive than the other two options. The RTX 5080 is a good option as well, but it is still more expensive than the 5070TI and does not offer a significant performance increase for my needs.
The RTX 5070TI offers a good balance of performance and price, making it the most suitable choice for my gaming and content creation needs. It provides ample VRAM and CUDA cores to handle modern games and applications, while also being more affordable than the higher-end models. Therefore, I will be going with the RTX 5070TI for my GPU upgrade.</p>
